## Stay informed

The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted there first.

You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, but you wonâ€™t miss anything essential if you only read the blog.

Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in the React repository, as well as on the Releases page.
